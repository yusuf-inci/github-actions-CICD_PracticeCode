## Generate GitHub Personal Access Token
Create personal access token to authenticate with GitHub. The minimum required scopes needed for this: repo, read:org, and workflow. Warning: Keep your tokens safe and protect them like passwords.
 $ gh auth login

$ export PS1="[\[\033[01;32m\]\u\[\033[00m\]: \[\033[01;34m\]\W\[\033[00m\]]\$ "
